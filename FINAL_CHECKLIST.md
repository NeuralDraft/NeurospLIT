  - [ ] "Create groups" is checked
  - [ ] "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED
  - [ ] "NeurospLIT" target is UNCHECKED
  - [ ] "NeurospLITTests" target is CHECKED
- [ ] Click "Add"

#### Step 5: Verify Target Membership
- [ ] Select `NeurospLIT/Application/NeurospLITApp.swift`
- [ ] File Inspector > Target Membership
- [ ] Verify "NeurospLIT" is checked

- [ ] Build Phases tab
- [ ] Verify Compile Sources includes:
  - [ ] NeurospLITApp.swift
  - [ ] Models.swift
  - [ ] All view files
  - [ ] All service files
  - [ ] All engine files
  - [ ] All utility files

- [ ] Verify Copy Bundle Resources includes:
  - [ ] Assets.xcassets
  - [ ] PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy

#### Step 7: Verify Build Settings
- [ ] Search for "Info.plist File"
- [ ] Verify `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES`
- [ ] Search for "Bundle Identifier"
- [ ] Verify `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = net.neuraldraft.NeurospLIT`
- [ ] Search for "Asset Catalog"
- [ ] Verify `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon`

**⚠️  ONLY after all tests pass!**

```powershell
# Run the cleanup script
.\Scripts\cleanup_old_structure.ps1
```

```bash
git add .
git status  # Review what will be committed
```

### Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Reorganize project structure following Swift best practices

- Organized source into NeurospLIT/ with clear hierarchy

## 🆘 **If Something Goes Wrong**

### Build Errors
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check `XCODE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` Common Issues section
3. Verify file target membership
4. Check Build Phases

### Test Errors
1. Check test target configuration
2. Verify host application setting
3. Check Bundle Loader setting
4. Ensure all test files in test target

### Runtime Crashes
1. Check console output
2. Look for purple warnings
3. Verify all @MainActor annotations
4. Check for nil references

### Nuclear Option
If all else fails:
1. Don't delete old directories yet
2. Create NEW Xcode project from scratch
3. Drag only new `NeurospLIT/` folder
4. Configure targets fresh
5. This guarantees clean project
