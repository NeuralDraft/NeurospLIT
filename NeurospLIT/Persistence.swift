// Legacy scaffolding removed.
// This file is intentionally minimal because the app has been consolidated into NeurospLITApp.swift.
// All models, services (API/StoreKit), views, and calculation engine now live in `NeurospLITApp.swift`.
// Keeping this stub avoids accidental reintroduction of duplicate symbols that break the build.
