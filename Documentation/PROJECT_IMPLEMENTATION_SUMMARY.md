# Project Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the "Project" feature for NeurospLIT, which allows users to organize tip templates into logical groups.

## Implementation Date

October 2025

## What Was Created

### 1. Data Model (Models/Domain/Models.swift)

**New Model Added:**
- `Project` struct with properties:
  - id, name, description, createdDate, updatedDate, color, templateIds

**Enhanced Model:**
- `TipTemplate` now includes optional `projectId: UUID?` property

### 2. Service Layer

**New File:** `NeurospLIT/Services/Managers/ProjectManager.swift`

A comprehensive service for managing projects with:
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Template association management
- Automatic persistence via UserDefaults
- SwiftUI integration with @Published properties
- Default "Project 1" creation on first launch

### 3. User Interface

**New File:** `NeurospLIT/Views/Projects/ProjectListView.swift`

Contains three SwiftUI views:
- **ProjectListView**: Main list view with create/delete functionality
- **ProjectDetailView**: Detailed view with edit capabilities
- **ProjectRowView**: Reusable row component with visual indicators

### 4. Tests

**New Files:**
- `NeurospLITTests/ModelTests/ProjectTests.swift` - Model tests
- `NeurospLITTests/ServiceTests/ProjectManagerTests.swift` - Service tests

Test coverage includes:
- Model initialization and Codable conformance
- CRUD operations
- Template association/disassociation
- Persistence verification
- Edge cases (duplicates, non-existent IDs, etc.)

### 5. Documentation

**New File:** `Documentation/PROJECT_FEATURE.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Feature overview
- Data model details
- Service API reference
- UI component descriptions
- Usage examples
- Architecture alignment
- Future enhancement suggestions

**Updated File:** `README.md`
- Added Project Organization to Core Functionality features
- Added PROJECT_FEATURE.md to documentation table

## Files Created/Modified

### Created (8 files)
1. `NeurospLIT/Services/Managers/ProjectManager.swift`
2. `NeurospLIT/Views/Projects/ProjectListView.swift`
3. `NeurospLITTests/ModelTests/ProjectTests.swift`
4. `NeurospLITTests/ServiceTests/ProjectManagerTests.swift`
5. `Documentation/PROJECT_FEATURE.md`
6. `Documentation/PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified (2 files)
1. `NeurospLIT/Models/Domain/Models.swift` - Added Project model, enhanced TipTemplate
2. `README.md` - Added feature description and documentation link

### Directories Created (3)
1. `NeurospLIT/Services/Managers/`
2. `NeurospLIT/Views/Projects/`
3. `NeurospLITTests/ModelTests/`

## Key Features

1. **Project Organization**: Users can create named projects to group related tip templates
2. **Visual Differentiation**: Projects support optional color coding
3. **Template Management**: Add/remove templates from projects
4. **Persistence**: All project data persists across app launches
5. **Default Project**: "Project 1" is created automatically on first launch
6. **Edit Support**: Users can update project names, descriptions, and colors
7. **Clean Architecture**: Follows established app architecture patterns

## Architecture Compliance

The implementation follows the established NeurospLIT architecture:

```
Level 0: Models (Project, TipTemplate enhancement)
    ↓
Level 2: Services (ProjectManager)
    ↓
Level 3: Views (ProjectListView, ProjectDetailView, ProjectRowView)
```

## Testing

All new code includes comprehensive tests:
- ✅ Model tests for data structures
- ✅ Service tests for business logic
- ✅ Codable tests for persistence
- ✅ Edge case handling

## Code Quality

- ✅ All Swift files pass syntax validation
- ✅ Follows Swift naming conventions
- ✅ Includes proper documentation comments
- ✅ Uses modern Swift features (@MainActor, async/await ready)
- ✅ SwiftUI best practices
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Integration Notes

To fully integrate this feature into the app:

1. Add ProjectListView to main navigation
2. Update template creation/editing to allow project selection
3. Add project filtering to template lists
4. Consider adding the ProjectManager to the main app state

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements documented in PROJECT_FEATURE.md:
- Cloud sync support
- Project sharing/collaboration
- Advanced filtering and search
- Export/import capabilities
- Project analytics
- Nested projects/sub-projects

## Default Behavior

When the app launches for the first time (or if no projects exist):
- A default project named "Project 1" is automatically created
- This provides users with an immediate starting point
- Users can rename, modify, or delete this default project

## Storage

- Projects stored in UserDefaults with key: `"neurosplit.projects"`
- JSON encoding/decoding via Swift Codable
- Automatic save on all modifications
- Automatic load on ProjectManager initialization

## Status

✅ **Complete and Ready for Integration**

All code has been written, tested (syntax validated), and documented. The feature is ready to be integrated into the main application flow.
