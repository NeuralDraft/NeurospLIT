### Project Files
- `App/project.pbxproj` → `SupportingFiles/NeurospLIT.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `App/NeurospLIT.xcscheme` → `SupportingFiles/NeurospLIT.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/`

### Documentation
- `Docs/*` → `Documentation/`
- `README_RECONSTRUCTION.md` → `Documentation/`

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Xcode Project (REQUIRED)

You must update the Xcode project to reference the new file locations:

```bash
# Option A: Manual in Xcode
1. Open SupportingFiles/NeurospLIT.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Right-click each file with red text (missing references)
3. Choose "Locate..." and find the file in its new location
4. Or delete old references and drag new folders into project

# Option B: Regenerate (if you have xcodeproj gem)
# This would recreate the project file with new structure
```

**Critical**: Ensure all files in `NeurospLIT/` are added to the **NeurospLIT target** and all files in `NeurospLITTests/` are added to the **NeurospLITTests target**.

### 2. Verify Imports (Should Work Automatically)

Since all files are still in the same module (NeurospLIT), import statements don't need to change. The code should compile as-is once Xcode project references are updated.

### 3. Test the Build

```bash
# Clean build folder
# In Xcode: Product > Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K)

# Build
# In Xcode: Product > Build (⌘B)

# Run tests
# In Xcode: Product > Test (⌘U)
```

### 4. Remove Old Directories (After Verification)

Once you've verified everything works, you can safely remove the old directories:

```bash
# Only after confirming everything works!
cd "c:\Users\Amirp\OneDrive\Desktop\NeurospLIT_reconstructed (1)"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force App, Views, Services, Engine, Utilities, Tests, Configs, Docs, Resources
```

## Benefits You'll See

### 1. Clearer Code Organization
- Find files by function, not by guessing
- New team members onboard faster
- Code reviews are easier

### 2. Better Dependency Management
```
Models (no deps) 
  ↓
Engine (uses models)
  ↓
Services (uses models + engine)
  ↓
Views (uses services)
  ↓
Application (coordinates all)
```

### 3. Improved Testability
- Test files mirror source structure
- Easy to find tests for any component
- Mocks are separate from implementation

### 4. Scalable Growth
- New features have obvious homes
- No more "where should this go?" questions
- Prevents technical debt accumulation

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "File not found" errors in Xcode

**Solution**: Update Xcode project file references (Step 1 above)

### Issue: Import statements failing

**Solution**: This shouldn't happen (same module), but verify:
1. All files are in the same target
2. Build settings are correct
3. Clean build folder and rebuild

### Issue: Tests not running

**Solution**: 
1. Verify test files are in NeurospLITTests target
2. Check test target build settings
3. Ensure MockURLProtocol is accessible

### Issue: Assets not loading

**Solution**:
1. Verify `NeurospLIT/Resources/Assets.xcassets` is added to target
2. Check asset catalog compiler settings
3. Ensure asset names haven't changed

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback:

1. The old directory structure is still intact (we copied, not moved)
2. Simply delete the new `NeurospLIT/` and `NeurospLITTests/` directories
3. Continue using the old structure

However, the new structure is recommended and follows industry best practices.

## What Wasn't Changed

✓ **Import statements** - All files still in same module
✓ **Class/struct names** - No code changes
✓ **Dependencies** - Same dependency graph
✓ **Functionality** - Code behavior unchanged
✓ **Old directories** - Still present for safety

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. See `Documentation/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for detailed structure info
2. See `Documentation/PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` for original plan
3. Refer to Apple's documentation on Xcode project organization

## Summary

✅ **Files organized by concern** (models, views, services, etc.)
✅ **Tests organized by type** (engine tests, service tests, view tests)
✅ **Clear dependency hierarchy** (bottom-up: models → services → views)
✅ **Configuration separated** from code
✅ **Documentation centralized**
✅ **Follows Swift/iOS best practices**
✅ **Ready for team collaboration**
✅ **Scalable for future growth**

**The reorganization is complete and your project is now industry-standard!**

**Migration Date**: October 2025
**Version**: Post-Reorganization 2.0
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Xcode Integration
